    abstract = "Diagnostic coding, or ICD coding, is the task of assigning diagnosis codes defined by the ICD (International Classification of Diseases) standard to patient visits based on clinical notes. The current process of manual ICD coding is time-consuming and often error-prone, which suggests the need for automatic ICD coding. However, despite the long history of automatic ICD coding, there have been no standardized frameworks for benchmarking ICD coding models.We open-source an easy-to-use tool named \textit{AnEMIC}, which provides a streamlined pipeline for preprocessing, training, and evaluating for automatic ICD coding. We correct errors in preprocessing by existing works, and provide key models and weights trained on the correctly preprocessed datasets. We also provide an interactive demo performing real-time inference from custom inputs, and visualizations drawn from explainable AI to analyze the models. We hope the framework helps move the research of ICD coding forward and helps professionals explore the potential of ICD coding. The framework and the associated code are available here.",

abstract = {Superpixels are higher-order perceptual groups of pixels in an image, often carrying much more information than the raw pixels. There is an inherent relational structure to the relationship among different superpixels of an image such as adjacent superpixels are neighbours of each other. Our interest here is to treat these relative positions of various superpixels as relational information of an image. This relational information can convey higher-order spatial information about the image, such as the relationship between superpixels representing two eyes in an image of a cat. That is, the two eyes are placed adjacent to each other in a straight line or the mouth is below the nose. Our motive in this paper is to assist computer vision models, specifically those based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), by incorporating this higher-order information from superpixels. We construct a hybrid model that leverages (a) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to deal with spatial information in an image and (b) Graph Neural Network (GNN) to deal with relational superpixel information in the image. The proposed model is learned using a generic hybrid loss function. Our experiments are extensive, and we evaluate the predictive performance of our proposed hybrid vision model on seven different image classification datasets from a variety of domains such as digit and object recognition, biometrics, medical imaging. The results demonstrate that the relational superpixel information processed by a GNN can improve the performance of a standard CNN-based vision system.},
