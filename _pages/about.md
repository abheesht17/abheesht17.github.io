I am an ML Research Scientist at [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/), where I work in the Traffic Quality team. My work involves devising ML techniques and algorithms to catch advertisement bots.

I am an avid open source contributor. I contribute
extensively to [KerasNLP](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-nlp), Keras' NLP offering and [Keras Core](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-core), the multi-backend version of Keras.

Outside of work, I'm a voracious reader, gobbling up anything to do with fantasy or science fiction. Mostly, you'll find me with a vacant expression on my face, concocting a novel plot, or singing melodies.
